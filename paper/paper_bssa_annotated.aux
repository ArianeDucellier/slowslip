The time period covered in 2016-2022. We mark by a red rectangle every time where the amplitude is higher than a threshold equal to 0.8 mm. We mark by a blue rectangle every time where the amplitude is lower than minus the threshold. We mark with a green bar the slow slip events from Table 6 detected with the wavelet method. Full lines correspond to robust detections (1 in Table 6) and dotted lines to less robust detections (2 in Table 6)}{figure.14}{}}
